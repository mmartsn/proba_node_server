'Oh darling, did you see that one?' one of the felines opines. 'I wouldn't mind sharing a dead mouse with him.' 'Oh, forget about him,' her friend tells her. 'I went out with him once, and all he did was talk about his operation.' A tomcat was heard running up and down the alley for hours. A neighbour called his owner and asked what was happening. The owner said, 'Well, I had him fixed today, and he's going around cancelling all his engagements.'"
